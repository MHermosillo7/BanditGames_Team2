//To note, this is supposed to be the parent class of subsquen characters
//However, I am still unsure which specific fields they would all have

//As for now, here would be where I include I guess the basis for the
//GCD (global move cooldown) and CD (normal move cooldown)

//Then, it would be possible to just let the child
//objects set what the moves would do and here handle
//the greater, shared logic

//It still remains as an idea though,
//which is why I will leave it empty for now
